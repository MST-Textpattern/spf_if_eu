h2. Usage:

# The plugin is intended to be used on page templates (e.g. to serve a cookie prompt such as "cPrompt":https://github.com/michaelw90/cPrompt or my "forked version":https://github.com/spiffin/cPrompt) - but it can also be used in articles and forms.
# Content within @<txp:spf_if_eu> ... </txp:spf_if_eu>@ tags will only be served to visitors from the EU.
# The @<txp:else />@ tag can also be used to serve content to non-EU visitors only.


h2. Notes:

# Country detection is via "MaxMind's":http://www.maxmind.com GeoIP database - it (very occasionally) makes errors.
# Not tested on Texpattern &lt; 4.4.1 and PHP &lt; 5.
